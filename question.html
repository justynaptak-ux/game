                There is a train that, much to your horror, is about to run over your closest family members, who have
                been tied to its track. It just so happens that you have just enough time to flip a switch that will
                send the train down a different track, saving them. However, tied to the other track, are ten innocent
                people in danger of being run over. You can either choose saving you family members, but letting ten
                innocent people die or sacrificing the ones you love for the sake of saving more lives. What would you
                do?
