                What's going on?</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(85, 76, 68);"> The Madrid sun was breaking into the room through the curtains. A
                windmill was buzzing quietly in the background. In a moment you were supposed to finish your work and
                gather at home. There was no one else in the office apart from you. You were finishing the last project
                concerning new electronic banking security features in the National Bank of Spain. Suddenly your
                computer screen went out, and a moment later you saw this message. </br>

                <span></span><b>"Casino del Papel. Today, at 8:00 p.m. You have to show up. M&M" </b></br>

                The message sounded serious. There was not much time left until 6 p.m. You tore your shirt off a chair
                and ran out of the office.The sky was slowly pinking over the city. All covered up sweat, you appeared
                in the casino door barely before time. You anxiously crossed the threshold.
