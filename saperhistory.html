            <p style="color: rgb(85, 76, 68); font-size: 1.8vw;">  In 1981 the history of one of the most famous and simplest computer games in history began. Added as an accessory to any Microsoft Windows system (up to version 7), it quickly became incredibly popular. This inconspicuous game was probably a nightmare for both office workers and their managers, who might have noticed a decrease in productivity of their employees.
Saper first appeared on Windows 3.1 in 1992. It's worth noting that the programmers didn't only want to make the players happy, as the title was supposed to make them used to using the right and left mouse button. Was it successful? This is probably a rhetorical question.</p>
